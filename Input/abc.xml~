The first two Prairie structures, the [[Dr. G.C. Stockman House]] (1908) and the [[Park Inn Hotel|Park Inn Hotel and City National Bank Buildings]] (1909–1910) were both designed by [[Frank Lloyd Wright]]. The hotel and bank, a [[mixed-use development]] at the corner of State and Federal Avenues, was the first to be commissioned by local attourneys James.E.E. Markley and James E. Blythe.  Within a year, Wright was hired to design the Stockman House by Markley's neighbor.&lt;ref&gt;
