Oskaloosa derives its name from Ouscaloosa who according to town lore was a [[Creek (people)|Creek]] princess who married [[Seminole]] chief [[Osceola]].  It means &quot;last of the beautiful.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;villageprofile.com&quot;&gt;http://www.villageprofile.com/iowa/oskaloosa/03his/main.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The first white settlers arrived in 1835 led by Nathan Boone, youngest son of [[Daniel Boone]] who acting on instructions from [[Stephen W. Kearny]] selected it to be the first site of [[Fort Des Moines]] on a high ridge between what [[Skunk River]] and [[Des Moines River]].  The ridge was originally called the Narrows.

[[Image:rooseveltoskaloosa.jpeg|thumb|left|alt=Theodore Roosevelt campaigns in Oskaloosa.|[[Theodore Roosevelt]] campaigns in the Oskaloosa city square in the fall of 1912.]]

The town was formally platted in 1844 when William Canfield who had a trading post on the [[Des Moines River]] moved it to Oskaloosa.  It became the county seat in the same year.&lt;ref name=&quot;villageprofile.com&quot;/&gt;

On January 6, 1882, most of the buildings in the north half of Oskaloosa were severely damaged and most of the plate glass windows in the area were broken by an explosion.  Three boys were killed in the explosion.  The boys had been seen shooting at the A. L. Spencer gunpowder magazine half a mile north of the town center.&lt;ref&gt;[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=980CE1D7153BE033A25754C0A9679C94639FD7CF The Explosion at Oskaloosa], New York Times, Jan. 7, 1882.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1880s, over a million tons of [[bituminous coal]] was mined in the area from 38 mines.  The first mine in the area was opened shortly after 1853 by Robert Seevers, who 1853 drove a [[Drift mining|drift]] into a 4-foot coalbed in an exposed creek bank east of town.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=1BUMAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA556 Iowa Geologic Survey Annual Report for 1908], 1909, Des Moines, page 556.&lt;/ref&gt;   Initially, coal was mined entirely for local consumption, but with the arrival of the railroads, coal from the region was shipped widely.  By 1887, the report of the state mine inspector listed 11 coal mines in and around Oskaloosa.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=PRAAAAAAMAAJ&amp;lpg=RA4-PA50&amp;pg=PA87 Third Biennial Report of the State Mine Inspectors to the Governor of Iowa for the years 1886 and 1887], Roberts, Des Moines, 1888, page 87&lt;/ref&gt;  The coal output of Mahaska County surpassed that of all other Iowa counties by 1895, by which time, the output had reached over a million tons per year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=PRAAAAAAMAAJ&amp;lpg=RA4-PA50&amp;pg=RA5-PA50 Seventh Biennial Report of the State Mine Inspectors to the Governor of the State of Iowa for the two years ending June 30, 1895], Conaway, Des Moines, 1895, page 50.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1911, coal mining was reported to be the primary industry in the region.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.1911encyclopedia.org/Oskaloosa Oskaloosa] in the Encyclopaedia Britannica, 1911 edition.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1914, the Carbon Block Coal Company of Centerville produced over 100,000 tons of coal, ranking among the top 24 coal producers in the state.&lt;ref&gt;Frederick E. Saward, [http://books.google.com/books?id=NO8oAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA65 The Coal Trade, 1915], page 65.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:samsmithcoal.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Oskaloosa coal mine.|The Sam Smith coal mine in 1895. It was located in what is now the 1300 block of High Avenue West.]]
There were several major coal-mining camps in the Oskaloosa area.  [[Consolidation Coal Company (Iowa)#Muchakinock|Muchakinock]] was about 5 miles south of town, on the banks of the Muchakinock Creek.  Lost Creek was a mining camp about 8 miles southeast of town.  On January 24, 1902, there was a mine explosion in the Lost Creek No. 2 mine.  This was one of only two major mine disasters in Iowa between 1888 and 1913.  A miner setting shots to [[Rock blasting|blast]] coal from the coal face re-used a hole left over from a previous failed shot, and the result was a coal [[dust explosion]] that detonated barrels of [[gunpowder]] stored in the mine.  20 men died on the site and 14 more were badly injured.  The explosion sparked a state-wide miner's [[Strike action|strike]], and as a result, the following April, a law was passed regulating blasting in coal mines.&lt;ref&gt;Albert H. Fay, [http://books.google.com/books?id=R38fAAAAYAAJ&amp;lpg=PA20&amp;pg=RA1-PA190 Coal-Mine Fatalities in the United States 1870-1914], Department of the Interior, Bureau of Mines, Washington DC, 1916, page 190.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paul Garvin, [http://books.google.com/books?id=3a1XkpBGdAcC&amp;lpg=PA199&amp;pg=PA198 Iowa's Minerals], Burr Oak Books, 1998, pages 198-199.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Education ==
Oskaloosa is the home of [[William Penn University]], a private, liberal arts college. It was founded by members of the [[Religious Society of Friends]] (Quakers) in 1873 as '''Penn College'''. In 1933, the name was changed to '''William Penn College''', and finally to William Penn University in 2000.

Oskaloosa was also the home of the now-defunct [[Oskaloosa College]].

The city's public system, Oskaloosa Community Schools, operates a high school, middle school, elementary school, and an alternative school.  Oskaloosa Elementary opened in January 2005, merging five smaller buildings scattered across the city.  The building is the largest elementary school in Iowa.

== Distinctions ==

In the city's town square is a bronze statue of [[Chief Mahaska]], the 19th-century leader of a Native American tribe called the Ioways, for whom Mahaska County was named. Recently restored, the artwork was completed in 1907 by an Iowa-born sculptor named [[Sherry Edmundson Fry]] (1879–1966). At the time it was commissioned, Fry was living in Paris. He returned to Iowa the following summer to make preparatory drawings of [[Meskwaki]] at the nearby [[Meskwaki Settlement|Settlement]] at Tama, Iowa, and to collect Indian artifacts and other reference materials. Returning to Paris, he began on a clay scale model, which he first showed at the Paris Salon in 1907. A year later, he exhibited the final full-sized sculpture, for which he won the [[Prix de Rome]]. Soon after, it was shipped to the US, and arrived in Oskaloosa by railroad in September. The formal dedication of the statue, which was attended by a crowd of about 12,000 people, was held on May 12, 1909.

Oskaloosa boasts two private homes designed in 1948-51 by American architect [[Frank Lloyd Wright]]. Typical of his [[Usonian]] homes, these include the [[Carroll Alsop House]] at 1907 A Street, and the [[Jack Lamberson House]] at 511 North Park Avenue.

Oskaloosa hosted the [[Iowa State Fair]] prior to the Civil War in 1858 and 1859.

In 1934, Oskaloosa became the first city in the United States to fingerprint all of its citizens, including children.

== Municipal Band &amp; Historic Bandstand ==
The first settlers in the area brought along their instruments and the universal, deep love of music. That led to the organization of a band in 1864. In 1880 the band was called the K. T. Band (for Knight Templars).  It was about 1882 when a double-deck bandstand was erected in the center of the city park. The band started playing in the city park when it was just a field. The construction of a brick walk through the park was done with money obtained from a local talent minstrel show.  In 1886 the K. T. Band went to St. Louis for their national conclave and was a tremendous hit. That marked the beginning of the band's prominence in the Midwest.
 
It was the genius of Charles L. Barnhouse that developed the band “atmosphere” from the time he came to Oskaloosa in 1891. He exerted a creative influence to build up a musical organization that would become the pride of the city. His band grew to statewide acclaim, becoming the official band of the Iowa State Fair for four years.  In 1904 the band became even more well known when it played at the National K.P. encampment in Louisville, Kentucky, and stopped off en route, by invitation, to play at the World's Fair in St. Louis. In the ensuing years the band became popular throughout Iowa and other states.
 


In 1907 and 1908 Oskaloosa had two bands playing concerts – the Iowa Brigade Band and LaRue's Band. The merchants on High Avenue West employed their own band to compete with the Iowa Brigade Band in the park on Saturday evenings.
 
In 1911 the citizens decided to beautify the city and they voted to fund improvements for the city park. The citizens recommended that a new bandstand be erected in the center of the park. The old double deck frame bandstand was moved to one side to be used while the new bandstand was being built. The first concert in the new bandstand was played on June 1, 1912, and the bandstand was dedicated on July 25, 1912.

A petition for incorporation was filed in District Court on June 11, 1872 with an election subsequently held in which there were 46 votes in favor and 16 votes against.

The completion of the Chicago, Burlington, and Quincy Railroad Line through Pleasantville in 1879 caused an increase in development and Pleasantville became one of the active business centers in Marion County and the principal shipping point between Knoxville and Des Moines.

The earliest population figures available begin in 1900 with 738 residents.

The first school was built in the fall of 1847, and in 1868, the school district joined with the Masonic Lodge in building a three story brick building that remained a school facility until 1992. Today, the Pleasantville School district consists of three buildings, an elementary, a middle school, and a high school.

==Sister cities==

Marshalltown has two official sister cities.  These are [[Minami-Alps, Yamanashi|Minami-Alps]] in the [[Yamanashi prefecture]] of [[Japan]] and [[Budyonnovsk]] in [[Stavropol Krai]], [[Russia]].

The unofficial sister city of Marshalltown is [[Villachuato]], [[Mexico]]. There is a symbiotic relationship between Marshalltown and Villachuato. Villachuato supplies about half of the workers to the Swift meatpacking plant.&lt;ref name=&quot;grey&quot;&gt;[http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3800/is_200201/ai_n9025860 &quot;Unofficial sister cities: Meatpacking labor migration between Villachauto, Mexico, and Marshalltown, Iowa&quot;] Mark A. Grey and Anne C. Woodrick&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, then Mayor Floyd Harthun of Marshalltown saw firsthand the degree of interdependence between the two communities when he visited their sister city Villachauto. In the mayor's words, &quot;I was being self serving. We need people.&quot; In addition to noting that about a third of the license plates in Villachuato were from Marshall County, Iowa, he also learned of the essential role of money sent by Villachuatans living in Marshalltown in providing electricity, underground water, road paving projects, and in restoring the town church and town plaza.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Illegal Immigration and the Swift &amp; Company Plant==

In 1996, the Swift meatpacking plant was raided by the INS and 148 Latino undocumented workers were arrested and deported.&lt;ref name=&quot;grey&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;woodrick&quot;&gt;[http://faculty.smu.edu/RKEMPER/UA_35_2-3_WOODRICK.pdf Preparing the Way: Hispanic Ministry and Community transformation in Marshalltown, Iowa] Anne C. Woodrick&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 12, 2006 the [[Immigration and Customs Enforcement]] (I.C.E) staged a coordinated predawn raid at the [[Swift &amp; Co.]] [[Meat packing industry|meat packing plant]] in Marshalltown and at 5 other Swift plants in western states, interviewing workers and removing hundreds in buses.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/13/us/13raid.html &quot;U.S. Raids 6 Meat Plants in ID Case&quot;], article [[New York Times]] by Julia Preston, December 13, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

The raid stemmed from a months long investigation into identity theft by illegal immigrants centered around the plant.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.desmoinesregister.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20061213/BUSINESS/612130392/1001&lt;/ref&gt; Of the 90 workers arrested by ICE in Marshalltown, 2 were charged with identity theft.&lt;ref name=&quot;dmregID&quot;&gt;[http://www.desmoinesregister.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20061213/BUSINESS01/61213017 ID theft probe began in Marshalltown] PHILIP BRASHER, Des Moines Register, December 13, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;  The rest were charged with administrative violations of immigration laws and 65 people were charged for identity theft and forgery.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.desmoinesregister.com/article/20061213/BUSINESS01/61213017/1001&lt;/ref&gt;

==Schools==
{{Refimprove|section|date=September 2007}}

Marshalltown has 6 public elementary schools — Anson, Fisher, Franklin, Hoglan, Rogers, and Woodbury. St. Mary's and St. Henry's Schools (Marshalltown Area Catholic Schools, and Marshalltown Christian School also provide private, religious elementary school education from preschool through 6th grade&lt;ref&gt;http://www.macs.pvt.k12.ia.us/&lt;/ref&gt;. Lenihan Intermediate School houses 5th and 6th graders; Seventh and 8th graders attend Miller Middle School. [[Marshalltown High School]] is home to the city's roughly 1700 9th through 12th grade students.

Fisher Elementary enrolls 346 students anywhere from K-4th grade.  They currently employ 51 staff members.

Franklin Elementary was built in 1913.  They currently enroll 400 students.  They currently employ 60 staff members.
**Note, the original Franklin Elementary was built in 1913 as stated above, however, that building was destroyed and
another was made in its place, also called Franklin Elementary. This building was built in the early 1990s and was
opened in the 1995-1996 school year.

Lenihan Intermediate was built in 1965 originally as a Catholic high school.  Construction cost $775,000.  It was designed to house 300 students. After five years in operation the administrators of Lenihan High School found it was financially impossible to continue providing quality education for their young people.  At the same time the public school in Marshalltown was overcrowded with students at the junior high level.  The solution decided upon by both parties was to sell Lenihan to the public school and to make the school a 7, 8, 9 junior high.  The transaction was completed and Lenihan Junior High became a reality in the fall of 1970.  The Catholic school name, mascot and school colors were all retained in the new public junior high school.

The need for additional space at Lenihan Junior High resulted in the construction of six rooms on the east side of the building in 1975.  The addition consisted of three regular classrooms, an art room and two industrial arts facilities.

In the late 1970s Lenihan Junior High’s enrollment was in the 470’s but then declined to a total of approximately 400 students.  In 1984 the 6th grade was added to the school which briefly put the enrollment over 500.  However, with declining enrollment the school housed between 400-450 students in grades 6-9 in the later part of the 1980s.  In the spring of 1988, the school board voted to close Lenihan at the end of the 1989 school year. An increase in population coupled with troubles equally distributing resources between two middle schools—Miller Middle School and Anson Middle School—led to a reorganization and unification of grades 5 and above within the city. Anson Middle School was closed as a school and now houses the district's Building and Grounds Department. Lenihan Junior High after its closure had served in various administrative functions, but was renovated to become Lenihan Intermediate School which opened for the 2006-2007 school year.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.marshalltown.k12.ia.us/schools/lenihan/index.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Matthew Arnold''' (24 December 1822 &amp;ndash; 15 April 1888) was an [[England|English]] [[poet]] and [[cultural critic]] who worked as an inspector of schools. He was the son of [[Thomas Arnold]], the famed headmaster of [[Rugby School]], and brother to both [[Tom Arnold (academic)|Tom Arnold]], literary professor, and [[William Delafield Arnold]], novelist and colonial administrator.  Matthew Arnold has been characterized as a [[sage writing|sage writer]], a type of writer who chastises and instructs the reader on contemporary social issues.&lt;ref&gt;Landow, George. Elegant Jeremiahs: The Sage from Carlyle to Mailer. Ithaca, New York: Cornell University Press, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;  

==Early years==
The Reverend [[John Keble]], who would become one of the leaders of the [[Oxford Movement]], stood as godfather to Matthew. &quot;Thomas Arnold admired Keble's 'hymns' in [[The Christian Year]], only reversing himself with exasperation when this old friend became a Romeward-tending '[[High Church]]' reactionary in the 1830s.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Honan, 1981, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1828, Arnold's father was appointed Headmaster of Rugby School and his young family took up residence, that year, in the Headmaster's house. In 1831, Arnold was tutored by his uncle, the Reverend John Buckland, at Laleham, Middlesex. In 1834, the Arnolds occupied a holiday home, Fox How, in the Lake District. [[William Wordsworth]] was a neighbor and close friend. Fox How then became the family home after Dr. Arnold's untimely death in 1842.

In 1836, Arnold was sent to [[Winchester College]], but in 1837 he returned to Rugby School where he was enrolled in the fifth form. He moved to the sixth form in 1838 and thus came under the direct tutelage of his father. He wrote verse for the manuscript Fox How Magazine produced by Matthew and his brother Tom for the family's enjoyment from 1838 to 1843. During his years as a Rugby student, he won school prizes for English essay writing, and Latin and English poetry. His prize poem, &quot;Alaric at Rome,&quot; was printed at Rugby.

In 1841, he won an open scholarship to [[Balliol College]], Oxford. During his residence at Oxford, his friendship ripened with [[Arthur Hugh Clough]], another graduate of Rugby who had been one of his father's favourites. Arnold attended [[John Henry Newman]]'s sermons at [[University Church of St Mary the Virgin|St. Mary's]], but did not join the Oxford Movement. His father died suddenly of heart disease in 1842. Arnold's poem &quot;Cromwell&quot; won the 1843 [[Newdigate prize]]. He graduated in the following year with a 2nd Class Honours degree in &quot;Greats.&quot;

In 1845, after a short interlude of teaching at Rugby, he was elected Fellow of [[Oriel College]], Oxford. In 1847, he became Private Secretary to [[Marquess of Lansdowne|Lord Lansdowne]], [[Lord President of the Council]]. In 1849, he published his first book of poetry, The Strayed Reveller. In 1850 Wordsworth died; Arnold published his &quot;Memorial Verses&quot; on the older poet in Fraser's Magazine.

==Marriage and a career==
Wishing to marry, but unable to support a family on the wages of a private secretary, Arnold sought the position of, and was appointed, in April 1851, one of Her Majesty's Inspector of Schools. Two months later, he married Frances Lucy, daughter of Sir William Wightman, Justice of the Queen's Bench. The Arnolds had six children: Thomas (1852–1868); Trevenen William (1853–1872); Richard Penrose (1855–1908), an inspector of factories;&lt;ref&gt;Composer [[Edward Elgar]] dedicated one of the [[Enigma Variations]] to Richard.&lt;/ref&gt; Lucy Charlotte (1858–1934) who married Frederick W. Whitridge of New York, whom she had met during Arnold's American lecture tour; Eleanore Mary Caroline (1861–1936) married (1) Hon. Armine Wodehouse in 1889, (2) William Masefield, Baron Sandhurst, in 1909; Basil Francis (1866–1868).

Arnold often described his duties as a school inspector as &quot;drudgery,&quot; although &quot;at other times he acknowledged the benefit of regular work.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Collini, 1988, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; The inspectorship required him, at least at first, to travel constantly and across much of England. &quot;Initially, Arnold was responsible for inspecting Nonconformist schools across a broad swath of central England. He spent many dreary hours during the 1850s in railway waiting-rooms and small-town hotels, and longer hours still in listening to children reciting their lessons and parents reciting their grievances. But that also meant that he, among the first generation of the railway age, travelled across more of England than any man of letters had ever done. Although his duties were later confined to a smaller area, Arnold knew the society of provincial England better than most of the metropolitan authors and politicians of the day.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Collini, 1988, p. 21&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literary career==
In 1852, Arnold published his second volume of poems, ''Empedocles on Etna, and Other Poems''. In 1853, he published ''Poems: A New Edition'', a selection from the two earlier volumes famously excluding ''Empedocles on Etna'', but adding new poems, ''[[Sohrab and Rustum]]'' and ''[[The Scholar Gipsy]]''. In 1854, ''Poems: Second Series'' appeared; also a selection, it included the new poem, ''[[Balder Dead]]''.

Arnold was elected [[Oxford Professor of Poetry|Professor of Poetry]] at Oxford in 1857. He was the first to deliver his lectures in English rather than Latin. He was re-elected in 1862. ''[[On Translating Homer]]'' (1861) and the initial thoughts that Arnold would transform into ''[[Culture and Anarchy]]'' were among the fruits of the Oxford lectures. In 1859, he conducted the first of three trips to the continent at the behest of parliament to study European educational practices. He self-published ''The Popular Education of France'' (1861), the introduction to which was later published under the title ''Democracy'' (1879).&lt;ref&gt;Super, CPW, II, p. 330.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1865, Arnold published ''Essays in Criticism: First Series''. ''Essays in Criticism: Second Series'' would not appear until November 1888, shortly after his untimely death. In 1866, he published ''[[Thyrsis]]'', his elegy to Clough who had died in 1861. ''Culture and Anarchy'', Arnold's major work in social criticism (and one of the few pieces of his prose work currently in print) was published in 1869. ''Literature and Dogma'', Arnold's major work in religious criticism appeared in 1873. In 1883 and 1884, Arnold toured the United States delivering lectures on education, democracy and [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]].

In 1886, he retired from school inspection and made another trip to America. Arnold died suddenly in 1888 of heart failure, when running to meet a tram that would have taken him to the Liverpool Landing Stage to see his daughter, who was visiting from the United States where she had moved after marrying an American.

==Arnold's character==
Matthew Arnold &quot;was indeed the most delightful of companions,&quot; wrote G. W. E. Russell in ''Portraits of the Seventies''; &quot;a man of the world entirely free from worldliness and a man of letters without the faintest trace of pedantry.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Russell, 1916.&lt;/ref&gt; A familiar figure at the [[Athenaeum Club, London|Athenaeum Club]], a frequent diner-out and guest at great country houses, fond of fishing and shooting, a lively conversationalist, affecting a combination of foppishness and Olympian grandeur, he read constantly, widely, and deeply, and in the intervals of supporting himself and his family by the quiet drudgery of school inspecting, filled notebook after notebook with meditations of an almost monastic tone. In his writings, he often baffled and sometimes annoyed his contemporaries by the apparent contradiction between his urbane, even frivolous manner in controversy, and the &quot;high seriousness&quot; of his critical views and the melancholy, almost plaintive note of much of his poetry. &quot;A voice poking fun in the wilderness&quot; was T. H. Warren's description of him.

==Poetry==

Arnold is sometimes called the third great Victorian poet, along with [[Alfred Tennyson, 1st Baron Tennyson]] and [[Robert Browning]].&lt;ref&gt;Collini, 1988, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Arnold was keenly aware of his place in poetry.  In an 1869 letter to his mother, he wrote: 
{{cquote|My poems represent, on the whole, the main movement of mind of the last quarter of a century, and thus they will probably have their day as people become conscious to themselves of what that movement of mind is, and interested in the literary productions which reflect it. It might be fairly urged that I have less poetical sentiment than Tennyson and less intellectual vigour and abundance than Browning; yet because I have perhaps more of a fusion of the two than either of them, and have more regularly applied that fusion to the main line of modern development, I am likely enough to have my turn as they have had theirs.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Lang, Volume 3, p. 347.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Stefan Collini]] regards this as &quot;an exceptionally frank, but not unjust, self-assessment.&quot;  &quot;Arnold's poetry continues to have scholarly attention lavished upon it, in part because it seems to furnish such striking evidence for several central aspects of the intellectual history of the nineteenth century, especially the corrosion of 'Faith' by 'Doubt'.  No poet, presumably, would wish to be summoned by later ages ''merely'' as an historical witness, but the sheer intellectual grasp of Arnold's verse renders it peculiarly liable to this treatment.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Collini, 1988, p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt;

Harold Bloom echoes Arnold's self reference in his introduction (as series editor) to the ''Modern Critical Views'' volume on Arnold: &quot;Arnold got into his poetry what Tennyson and Browning scarcely needed (but absorbed anyway), the main march of mind of his time.&quot;  Of his poetry, Bloom says, &quot;Whatever his achievement as a critic of literature, society, or religion, his work as a poet may not merit the reputation it has continued to hold in the twentieth century.  Arnold is, at his best, a very good but highly derivative poet....  As with Tennyson, Hopkins, and Rossetti, Arnold's dominant precursor was Keats, but this is an unhappy puzzle, since Arnold (unlike the others) professed not to admire Keats greatly, while writing his own elegiac poems in a diction, meter, imagistic procedure, that are embarrassingly close to Keats.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Bloom, 1987, pp. 1-2.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sir Edmund Chambers noted, however, that &quot;in a comparison between the best works of Matthew Arnold and that of his six greatest contemporaries... the proportion of work which endures is greater in the case of Matthew Arnold than in any one of them.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Chambers, 1933, p. 159.&lt;/ref&gt; Chambers judged Arnold's poetic vision by &quot;its simplicity, lucidity, and straightforwardness; its literalness...; the sparing use of aureate words, or of far-fetched words, which are all the more effective when they come; the avoidance of inversions, and the general directness of syntax, which gives full value to the delicacies of a varied rhythm, and makes it, of all verse that I know, the easiest to read aloud.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Chambers, 1933, p. 165.&lt;/ref&gt;

He has a primary school named after him in Liverpool, where he died, and secondary schools named after him in Oxford and Staines. 

His literary career — leaving out the two prize poems — had begun in 1849 with the publication of ''The Strayed Reveller and Other Poems'' by A., which attracted little notice — although it contained perhaps Arnold's most purely poetical poem &quot;The Forsaken Merman&quot; — and was soon withdrawn. ''Empedocles on Etna and Other Poems'' (among them &quot;[[Tristram and Iseult]]&quot;), published in 1852, had a similar fate. In 1858 he brought out his tragedy of &quot;Merope,&quot; calculated, he wrote to a friend, &quot;rather to inaugurate my Professorship with dignity than to move deeply the present race of humans,&quot; and chiefly remarkable for some experiments in unusual — and unsuccessful — metres. 

His 1867 poem &quot;[[Dover Beach]]&quot; depicted a nightmarish world from which the old religious verities have receded. It is sometimes held up as an early, if not the first, example of the [[modern sensibility]].  In a famous preface to a selection of the poems of [[William Wordsworth]], Arnold identified himself, a little ironically, as a &quot;Wordsworthian.&quot;  The influence of Wordsworth, both in ideas and in diction, is unmistakable in Arnold's best poetry.  Arnold's poem, &quot;Dover Beach&quot; appears in Ray Bradbury's ''[[Fahrenheit 451]]'' and is also featured prominently in ''[[Saturday (novel)|Saturday]]'' by [[Ian McEwan]]. It has also been quoted or alluded to in a variety of other contexts (see [[Dover Beach]]).

Some consider Arnold to be the bridge between [[Romanticism]] and [[Modernism]].  His use of symbolic landscapes was typical of the Romantic era, while his skeptical and pessimistic perspective was typical of the Modern era. The [[Rationalism|rationalistic]] tendency of certain of his writings gave offence to many readers, and the sufficiency of his equipment in scholarship for dealing with some of the subjects which he handled was called in question, but he undoubtedly exercised a stimulating influence on his time. His writings are characterised by the finest culture, high purpose, sincerity, and a style of great distinction, and much of his poetry has an exquisite and subtle beauty, though here also it has been doubted whether [[high culture]] and wide knowledge of poetry did not sometimes take the place of true poetic fire.  [[Henry James]] wrote that Matthew Arnold's poetry will appeal to those who &quot;like their pleasures rare&quot; and who like to hear the poet &quot;taking breath.&quot;

The mood of Arnold’s poetry tends to be of plaintive reflection, and he is restrained in expressing emotion. He felt that poetry should be the ‘criticism of life’ and express a philosophy. Arnold’s philosophy is that true happiness comes from within, and that people should seek within themselves for good, while being resigned in acceptance of outward things and avoiding the pointless turmoil of the world. However, he argues that we should not live in the belief that we shall one day inherit eternal bliss. If we are not happy on earth, we should moderate our desires rather than live in dreams of something that may never be attained. This philosophy is clearly expressed in such poems as &quot;Dover Beach&quot; and in these lines from &quot;Stanzas from the Grande Chartreuse&quot;:

::Wandering between two worlds, one dead
::The other powerless to be born,
::With nowhere yet to rest my head
::Like these, on earth I wait forlorn.

Arnold valued natural scenery for its peace and permanence in contrast with the ceaseless change of human things. His descriptions are often picturesque, and marked by striking similes. However, at the same time he liked subdued colours, mist and moonlight. He seems to prefer the ‘spent lights’ of the sea-depths in &quot;The Forsaken Merman&quot; to the village life preferred by the merman’s lost wife. 

In his poetry he derived not only the subject matter of his narrative poems from various traditional or literary sources but even much of the romantic melancholy of his earlier poems from [[Senancour]]'s &quot;Obermann&quot;. His greatest defects as a poet stem from his lack of ear and his frequent failure to distinguish between poetry and prose.

Crowell &amp; Co. |editor=Nathan Dole}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Prose ==

Assessing the importance of Arnold's prose work in 1988, Stefan Collini stated, &quot;for reasons to do with our own cultural preoccupations as much as with the merits of his writing, the best of his prose has a claim on us today that cannot be matched by his poetry.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Collini, 1988, p. vii.&lt;/ref&gt;  &quot;Certainly there may still be some readers who, vaguely recalling 'Dover Beach' or '[[The Scholar Gipsy]]' from school anthologies, are surprised to find he 'also' wrote prose.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Collini, 1988, p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt;

George Watson follows George Saintsbury in dividing Arnold's career as a prose writer into three phases: 1) early literary criticism that begins with his preface to the 1853 edition of his poems and ends with the first series of ''Essays in Criticism'' (1865); 2) a prolonged middle period (overlapping the first and third phases) characterized by social, political and religious writing (roughly 1860-1875); 3) a return to literary criticism with the selecting and editing of collections of Wordsworth's and Byron's poetry and the second series of ''Essays in Criticism''.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, 1962, pp. 150-160. Saintsbury, 1899, p. 78 passim.&lt;/ref&gt;  Both Watson and Saintsbury declare their preference for Arnold's literary criticism over his social or religious criticism.  More recent writers, such as Collini, have shown a greater interest in his social writing,&lt;ref&gt;Collini, 1988.  Also see the introduction to ''Culture and Anarchy and other writings'', Collini, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; while over the years a significant second tier of criticism has focused on Arnold's religious writing.&lt;ref&gt;See &quot;The Critical Reception of Arnold's Religious Writings&quot; in Mazzeno, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;  His writing on education has not drawn a significant critical endeavor separable from the criticism of his social writings.&lt;ref&gt;Mazzeno, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Selections from the Prose Work of Matthew Arnold''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Arnold |first=Matthew |title=Selections from the Prose Work of Matthew Arnold |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=820AAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=The+Prose+of+Matthew+Arnold#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false |year=1913 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |editor= William S. Johnson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Literary criticism===
Arnold's work as a literary critic began with the 1853 &quot;Preface to the Poems&quot;. In it, he attempted to explain his extreme act of self-censorship in excluding the dramatic poem &quot;Empedocles on Etna&quot;.  With its emphasis on the importance of subject in poetry, on &quot;clearness of arrangement, rigor of development, simplicity of style&quot; learned from the Greeks, and in the strong imprint of Goethe and Wordsworth, may be observed nearly all the essential elements in his critical theory.  George Watson described the preface, written by the thirty-one year old Arnold, as &quot;oddly stiff and graceless when we think of the elegance of his later prose.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Watson, 1962, p. 147.&lt;/ref&gt;  

Criticism began to take first place in Arnold's writing with his appointment in 1857 to the professorship of poetry at Oxford, which he held for two successive terms of five years. In 1861 his lectures ''[[On Translating Homer]]'' were published, to be followed in 1862 by ''Last Words on Translating Homer'', both volumes admirable in style and full of striking judgments and suggestive remarks, but built on rather arbitrary assumptions and reaching no well-established conclusions. Especially characteristic, both of his defects and his qualities, are on the one hand, Arnold's unconvincing advocacy of English [[hexameter]]s and his creation of a kind of literary absolute in the &quot;grand style,&quot; and, on the other, his keen feeling of the need for a disinterested and intelligent criticism in England. 

Although Arnold's poetry received only mixed reviews and attention during his lifetime, his forays into literary criticism were more successful.  Arnold is famous for introducing a methodology of [[literary criticism]] somewhere between the historicist approach common to many critics at the time and the personal essay; he often moved quickly and easily from literary subjects to political and social issues.  His ''Essays in Criticism'' (1865, 1888), remains a significant influence on critics to this day. In one of his most famous essays on the topic, “The Study of Poetry”, Arnold wrote that, “Without poetry, our science will appear incomplete; and most of what now passes with us for religion and philosophy will be replaced by poetry”. He considered the most important criteria used to judge the value of a poem were “high truth” and “high seriousness”. By this standard, Chaucer’s [[Canterbury Tales]] did not merit Arnold’s approval. Further, Arnold thought the works that had been proven to possess both “high truth” and “high seriousness”, such as those of Shakespeare and Milton, could be used as a basis of comparison to determine the merit of other works of poetry. He also sought for literary criticism to remain disinterested, and said that the appreciation should be of “the object as in itself it really is.&quot;

===Social criticism===
He was led on from literary criticism to a more general critique of the [[Zeitgeist|spirit of his age]]. Between 1867 and 1869 he wrote ''[[Culture and Anarchy]]'', famous for the term he popularised for the middle class of the English [[Victorian era]] population: &quot;[[Philistines]]&quot;, a word which derives its [[philistinism|modern cultural meaning]] (in English - the German-language usage was well established) from him.  ''Culture and Anarchy'' is also famous for its popularization of the phrase &quot;sweetness and light,&quot; first coined by [[Jonathan Swift]].&lt;ref&gt;The New Dictionary of Cultural Literacy, Third Edition. [http://www.bartleby.com/59/6/sweetnessand.html Sweetness and light]. Houghton Mifflin Company.&lt;/ref&gt;

Arnold's &quot;want of logic and thoroughness of thought&quot; as noted by [[John M. Robertson]] in ''Modern Humanists'' was an aspect of the inconsistency of which Arnold was accused.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Robertson |first=John M. |title=Modern Humanists |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=eccMAQAAIAAJ&amp;dq=Johnson++Modern+humanists&amp;lr= |page=145 |publisher=S. Sonnenschein |year=1901 |quote=If, then, a man come to the criticism of life as Arnold did, with neither a faculty nor a training for logic... it is impossible that he should escape frequent error or inconsistency...}}&lt;/ref&gt; Few of his ideas were his own, and he failed to reconcile the conflicting influences which moved him so strongly. &quot;There are four people, in especial,&quot; he once wrote to [[Cardinal Newman]], &quot;from whom I am conscious of having learnt — a very different thing from merely receiving a strong impression — learnt habits, methods, ruling ideas, which are constantly with me; and the four are — [[Goethe]], [[Wordsworth]], [[Sainte-Beuve]], and yourself.&quot; Dr. Arnold must be added; the son's fundamental likeness to the father was early pointed out by [[Algernon Charles Swinburne|Swinburne]], and was later attested by Matthew Arnold's grandson, Mr. Arnold Whitridge. Brought up in the tenets of the Philistinism which, as a professed cosmopolitan and the Apostle of Culture he attacked, he remained something of a Philistine to the end.

===Journalistic criticism===
In 1887, Arnold was credited with coining the phrase &quot;New Journalism&quot;, a term that went on to define an entire genre of newspaper history, particularly [[Alfred Harmsworth|Lord Northcliffe's]] turn-of-the-century press empire. However, at the time, the target of Arnold's irritation was not [[Alfred Harmsworth|Northcliffe]], but the sensational journalism of [[Pall Mall Gazette]] editor, [[William Thomas Stead|W.T. Stead]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;We have had opportunities of observing a new journalism which a clever and energetic man has lately invented. It has much to recommend it; it is full of ability, novelty, variety, sensation, sympathy, generous instincts; its one great fault is that it is feather-brained.&quot; Mathew Arnold, The Nineteenth century No. CXXIII. (May, 1887) pp. 629-643. Available online at http://www.attackingthedevil.co.uk/related/easter.php&lt;/ref&gt;
Arnold had enjoyed a long and mutually beneficial association with the [[Pall Mall Gazette]] since its inception in 1865.   As an occasional contributor, he had formed a particular friendship with its first editor, [[Frederick Greenwood]] and a close acquaintance with its second, [[John Morley]]. But he strongly disapproved of the muck-raking [[William Thomas Stead|Stead]], and declared that, under Stead, &quot;the P.M.G., whatever may be its merits, is fast ceasing to be literature.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Harold Begbie, [http://www.salvationarmysouth.org/booth/v2-4.htm The Life of General William Booth], (2 vols., New York, 1920). Available [online]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religious criticism===

His religious views were unusual for his time. Scholars of Arnold's works disagree on the nature of Arnold's personal religious beliefs. Under the influence of [[Baruch Spinoza]] and his father, Dr. Thomas Arnold, he rejected the superstitious elements in religion, even while retaining a fascination for church rituals. Arnold seems to belong to a pragmatic middle ground that is more concerned with the poetry of religion and its virtues and values for society than with the existence of God. 

He wrote in the preface of ''God and the Bible'' in 1875 “The personages of the Christian heaven and their conversations are no more matter of fact than the personages of the Greek Olympus and their conversations.”&lt;ref&gt;Super, CPW, VII, p. 384.&lt;/ref&gt;   He also wrote in ''Literature and Dogma'': &quot;The word 'God' is used in most cases as by no means a term of science or exact knowledge, but a term of poetry and eloquence, a term thrown out, so to speak, as a not fully grasped object of the speaker's consciousness — a literary term, in short; and mankind mean different things by it as their consciousness differs.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Super, CPW, VI, p. 171.&lt;/ref&gt;  He defined religion as &quot;morality touched with emotion&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Super, CPW, VI, p. 176.&lt;/ref&gt;  

However, he also wrote in the same book, &quot;to pass from a Christianity relying on its miracles to a Christianity relying on its natural truth is a great change. It can only be brought about by those whose attachment to Christianity is such, that they cannot part with it, and yet cannot but deal with it sincerely.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Super, CPW, VI, p. 143.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[mayor]] of Melbourne from 1984 until 1998 was [[Bill Crews]], an openly [[homosexuality|gay]] man who came out of the closet in 1993. At the time, Melbourne was believed to be the smallest municipality in the United States to have an openly gay mayor.

'''Glenwood''' is a city in [[Mills County, Iowa|Mills County]], [[Iowa]], [[United States]]. The population was 5,358 at the 2000 census. It is the [[county seat]] of [[Mills County, Iowa|Mills County]]{{GR|6}}.

==History==
Located in a hollow of the [[Loess Hills]], Glenwood was established by [[Mormons]] in 1848 as Coonsville and prospered during the [[California Gold Rush]] largely due to the [[grain mill]] on Keg Creek. Coonsville was the scene of [[anti-Mormon]] mob violence, became the [[county seat]] of [[Mills County, Iowa|Mills County]] in 1851, and was renamed Glenwood after the bulk of Mormons left for [[Utah]] in 1852. The community was active in the creation of [[Nebraska Territory]] in 1854, including two Glenwood attorneys elected to the Nebraska territorial legislature who were run out of town for accepting shares in [[Scriptown]]. At the end of the Civil War, an Iowa Veteran's Orphans Home was located here where evangelist [[Billy Sunday]] spent time as a child.

The [[Burlington and Missouri River Railroad]] was completed through Glenwood in 1869 and during the late 19th century the community was widely known as Iowa's center of fruit production, particularly apples, and hosted an annual Apple Carnival. Other early industries included an iron foundry, an expansive marble and stone works, the Glenwood Creamery, and a large cannery that covered a city block on the east side of Locust Street and distributed its products under the brand-name &quot;The Glenwood&quot;. Darting &amp; McGavern's &quot;Sanitary&quot; cannery on South Vine and Railroad Avenue canned tomatoes, pumpkin, apples, and beets into the 1920s.

In 1876 the State Veteran's Orphan's Home at Glenwood became the Iowa [[Psychiatric hospital|Asylum]] for [[Feeble-Minded]] Children, the 7th such facility in the country and the first located west of the Mississippi River. The Glenwood facility expanded greatly with the treatment of [[mental retardation]] and acceptance of [[eugenics]] and became the [[Iowa Institution for Feeble-Minded Children]]. The grounds and now demolished Administration Building were largely patterned on the [[Kirkbride Plan]], as state funding permitted. The institution has long dominated Glenwood both economically and culturally although the IIFMC was self-sufficient and the residents were intentionally isolated from the rest of the town. By 1925 the Glenwood IIFMC was the home of 1,555 inmates categorized between [[Idiot (usage)|idiot]]s, [[imbecile]]s, and [[Moron (psychology)|moron]]s. The IIFMC became the Glenwood State-Hospital School in 1941 and during the early 1950s covered {{convert|1185|acre|km2|0}} with 310 staff members responsible for the 1,968 patients who were subjected to state-mandated [[Sterilization (surgical procedure)|sterilization]] and experiments. Deinstitutionalization of Glenwood began in the late 1950s, especially after the November 17, 1957 [[Des Moines Register]] revealed that Mayo Buckner had spent 59 years confined to Glenwood with a 120 IQ. National attention came to Buckner and the Glenwood State-Hospital School in the December 9, 1957 issue of [[Time Magazine]] and the March 25, 1958 issue of [[Life Magazine]]. The transformation from traditional ward buildings into [[group home]] styled cottages was largely completed during the 1970s. The facility is now known as the Glenwood Resource Center.

After World War II Glenwood also became a [[meat-packing]] center and during the early 1950s was home to one of America's largest [[Kosher]] packinghouses with most of its product shipped to New York and the East Coast. The packinghouse was later modified to process both cattle and pork and became part of [[Swift &amp; Company]] before it was closed in the 1980s. Trajet, a whirlpool manufacturer, now occupies the former slaughterhouse. A large industrial laundry also operated for most of the 20th century until it was purchased and closed by [[Cintas]]. The [[BNSF]], [[Loess Hills]] [[National Scenic Byway]], [[U.S. Route 34]], and [[U.S. Route 275]] all pass through Glenwood and [[Interstate 29]] is located a few miles west on the floodplain of the [[Missouri River]].

* The First Christian Church at 305 First Street was built in 1867 at a cost of $1,800. It has been a private residence for many years.
* 411 Sharp is a unique two story [[Italianate]] commercial building on the south side of the Glenwood Courthouse Square that was constructed in 1874 with prominent window hoods and is presently the location of Keg Creek Boot &amp; Saddle.

* The Hubbell Home at 202 Locust was built in the early 20th century and remains interesting for its [[Queen Anne Style]], prominent dormer windows, and adjacent stable long since converted into a garage.
* The Robinson Block at 102 South Walnut on the Glenwood Courthouse Square was constructed during the early 20th century and features a variety of 19th century architectural elements, including a second-story [[bay window]].
* The Buffington Block at 420 1st Street was built on the north side of the Glenwood Courthouse Square during the 1890s with one of the town's most distinguished cornices and seven second-story [[Italianate]] arched windows. A [[Ben Franklin Stores]] operated here during the latter half of the 20th century.
* The Wheeler's Super Service Station at 102 South Vine on the Glenwood Courthouse Square was constructed during the early 1920s to serve traffic along the Bluegrass Highway which became [[U.S. Route 34]]. The one-story brick building is unusual locally for its early [[Moderne]] architecture.
* The Glenwood [[Opera House]] Block at 412-416 First Street was built in 1891 on the Glenwood Courthouse Square with a variety of [[Richardsonian Romanesque]] elements. It first began showing motion pictures in 1908, became the Rex Theater by the 1920s, and, after many ownership changes, continues to show movies to the present day although live performances ended in the mid-20th century.
* The Mintle Company Building is a one-story late [[Moderne]] structure at 209 Sharp that was built in 1947 along what was then [[U.S. Route 34]]. Mintle was a dealer in [[JI Case]] farm equipment, [[Pontiac]] automobiles, and offered a full line of [[Frigidaire]] products. The building is now used as the Glenwood Police Department.
* Lilac Terrace were the neighborhoods that developed after the &quot;West Hill&quot; school was completed in 1868. By the early 20th century the area west of Sharp and Hazel Streets was one of the community's more prestigious addresses and still contains some notable architectural styles, including LW Russell home, the HM Bogan and James Miller homes, and particularly the [[Queen Anne Style]] William Lamb mansion on the northwest corner of Hazel and Sharp Streets which has been divided into apartments. Also of interest are the Morris Kaiman home at 102 South Hazel, the Robinson home at 105 North Hazel, and the Addison Meyers home at 404 North Hazel. The [[Works Progress Administration|WPA]] financed Glenwood High School replaced the West Hill School in 1937, became Glenwood [[Junior High]] from 1966–1987, and is now part of West Elementary.
* [[Glenwood Golf Course]] was opened in 1964 to be the cities first and only golf course. It was designed by Tom Davis.
* Seminary Hill immediately north of the Glenwood Courthouse Square developed after the late 1860s when the private Western Iowa College opened on the city block west of Chestnut between First and Second Streets. This became the Glenwood Methodist Seminary in the 1870s and the location of the East School until the 1970s. The surrounding neighborhood still contains a majority of the town's dominant [[Protestant]] churches, including the Glenwood First [[Congregational Church]] at 407 Second Street established by [[abolitionist]] [[John Todd]] in 1857. Nearby are the 1884 Saint John's [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]] at 111 North Vine, the 1911 Glenwood [[Baptist Church]] at 212 North Vine, the 1892 Glenwood First Christian at 202 North Vine, the 1905 Grace United [[Methodist]] at 112 North Walnut, the 1899 [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]] at 205 Third Street, and the 1949 Trinity [[Missouri Synod]] [[Lutheran]] Church at 512 Second Street. Also of interest is the Glenwood Public Library at 109 North Vine, a [[Carnegie library]] constructed in 1906 and expanded in 1982. The neighborhood formerly had several outstanding architectural examples, including the Dr. Donelan home and the 1870s two-story brick [[Italianate]] William Anderson mansion at North Walnut and Second Street that was razed in 2006. Another example of an 1870s brick [[Italianate]] residence in the 100 block of North Vine is presently divided into apartments.

The Mills County Fair is held here, although Glenwood is the county seat. Malvern is the largest town in the eastern half of the county.

==History==
The pioneer village of Milton was established in the fall of 1869. It was later renamed Malvern when it was discovered that there was already another Milton, Iowa. It was one of four communities in the area that came into existence with the completion of the Burlington and Missouri River Railroad on November 18, 1869.

John D. Paddock and his bride were the first residents of Malvern. They arrived in September and put up a small one and a half story building that served as their home and the community’s first store.

The completion of the railroad soon brought a flood of new residents and business enterprises. White Cloud, a town of perhaps 200 persons and a variety of businesses, was located about where the present Wabash Trace Nature Trail crosses the Nishnabotna River three miles southeast of Malvern. It soon closed down when the new railroad was built two miles north. Several business enterprises and White Cloud residents moved to Malvern.

Malvern grew almost explosively in its first two years. In its fifth year, Mr. Paddock reported in his Brief History of Malvern, it had a population of 800. It served a particularly productive farming area. It soon had a number of factories, including a hog packing plant, an electric generation plant (in 1892) which permitted a municipal water system, and in the early part of the twentieth century, developed a varied poultry industry that at one time furnished employment for up to 200 persons. Malvern started a school system in 1870, a county fair in 1873, a Chautauqua in 1905, built the town library in 1916 and the present Liberty Memorial Community Building in 1926

When the “good roads” movement came to Iowa, the town was omitted from Highway 34, causing some economic stress. At the time it also had the Wabash and Tabor &amp; Northern Railroads, which were also having some economic stress. The town experienced additional stress in the 1950s when much of Iowa’s poultry industry moved to Arkansas.

The success of the Malvern community has always been linked to agriculture in many ways. When fewer family farms and farm workers, became the norm, in the 1960’s, 1970’s, and especially the difficult 1980’s, the economy of Malvern suffered as well, losing many of the established businesses that had so long lined the streets in this community.

Today Malvern is a rural community with its own school system recently renamed as East Mills, a golf course, swimming pool, new library and Carnegie Conference Center, agricultural businesses and government offices, a bank, two residential care facilities, physician’s offices, Mills County Fair Grounds, the Wabash Trace Nature Trail, and numerous other small businesses. Population in Mills County is growing at one of the top ten rates across the state of Iowa. Malvern’s population is growing as well thanks to new housing developments in and around the community.

'''Pacific Junction''' is a city in [[Mills County, Iowa|Mills County]], [[Iowa]], [[United States]]. The population was 507 at the 2000 census.

==History==
&quot;PJ&quot; was established by the railroad in 1871 to serve as the western terminus of the [[Burlington and Missouri River Railroad]], the eastern terminus of the Nebraska Burlington &amp; Missouri River RR, and a station on the [[Kansas City, Council Bluffs, &amp; Saint Joseph Railroad]].  All three were consolidated as part of the [[Chicago, Burlington and Quincy]] Railroad, today's [[BNSF]].  After several rough and tumble years of growth Pacific Junction was incorporated in 1882.  The scene of violence during the railroad strikes of 1888, PJ's population peaked during the early 20th century with just over 700 people. Railroad traffic through town remains almost constant although the town's connections to the railroad have declined significantly since 1971.  Historic structures include the 1914 Pacific Junction Public School which graduated its last high school class in 1961 and closed for good in 1986.

'''St. Ansgar''' is a city in [[Mitchell County, Iowa|Mitchell County]], [[Iowa]], [[United States]]. The population was 1,031 at the 2000 census.

==History==
[[St. Ansgar]] is named for the [[St. Ansgar|patron saint of Scandinavia]], a [[French people|French]] [[Benedictine]] monk who Christianized much of Denmark, Sweden, and northern Germany between 830 and 865 A.D. The town is the site of a pioneer [[Norwegian Lutheran Church]] founded in December 1853 by Rev. [[Claus Lauritz Clausen]], a Dane who was commissioned by the Lutheran Church of Norway to form congregations for Norwegian immigrants in Wisconsin, Iowa, and Minnesota.

The St. Ansgar church, congregation and town served as a center for the dispersion of Norwegian settlers north across the border into Minnesota and on into western Iowa from the mid-1850s into the late 1870s. Clausen formed 21 additional congregations. St. Ansgar First Lutheran, a graceful building constructed of limestone quarried from the banks of the nearby Cedar River and native hardwoods, is the oldest continuously active Lutheran congregation west of the Mississippi (Booklet published by the First Lutheran Church of St. Ansgar on the occasion of the 150th anniversary of the congregation, 1853–2003; available in the Iowa State Historical Society collection, Iowa City, Iowa, and at the church.)

Pastors in the National Church of Norway received university training in census record keeping; the current parish keeps copies of congregation records continuously from founding to the present, making these records a significant genealogical resource.

A fortified stone outbuilding locally called Fort Severson, one half mile west of St. Ansgar (on a gravel side road; signage is only on hard surface state highway 105), was built in 1867 by settlers associated with the Clausen settlement anxious about the continued presence of Sauk and Fox Native Americans traveling through the area along the Deer Creek and the Cedar River. The settlers fears were animated by the killing of settlers at Spirit Lake Iowa in 1857 and in New Ulm, Minnesota in 1862. The distinctively fortified building, which functioned both as a barn and a fort, is the sole surviving example of many that were built. The site is open to the public, albeit requiring of persistence to find. (See St. Ansgar home page.)[http://72.14.207.104/search?]

==Geography==
St. Ansgar is located at {{coord|43|22|44|N|92|55|10|W|city}} (43.378814, -92.919576){{GR|1}}.

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of 0.8&amp;nbsp;[[square mile]]s (2.0&amp;nbsp;[[km²]]), all of it land.

==Demographics==
As of the [[census]]{{GR|2}} of 2000, there were 1,031 people, 447 households, and 282 families residing in the city. The [[population density]] was 1,320.7 people per square mile (510.3/km²).

'''Castana''' is a city in [[Monona County, Iowa|Monona County]], [[Iowa]], [[United States]]. The population was 178 at the 2000 census.

==History==
The city was founded in the summer of 1866 by A.G. Hammond, formerly a resident of [[Hartford, Connecticut|Hartford]], [[Connecticut]]. However Mr. Hammond died and a Mr. Day, who had been employed to work on the building, formed a company and completed building a store, which opened amid much celebration on 4 July 1867. Day then secured the office of post master and by 1872 there was also a blacksmith shop, two other shops and a franchise of Penn Bros, with a methodist minister living nearby and also a mill. Efforts to encourage the [[American Emigrant Company]] to provide funds of $2,000 to start a school lost out to a rival project in [[Belvidere]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.castanaiowa.com/mycustompage0006.htm The Early Years, Old Castana], accessed 24 March 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Eskimo Pie]] was created in Onawa in 1920 by Chris Nelson, an ice cream shop owner.  A young customer could not decide between an ice cream sandwich and a chocolate bar, so Nelson created a chocolate covered ice cream bar. The original product was called the &quot;I-Scream-Bar&quot;.  The creation was put on a stick in 1934.  In 1921 Nelson entered into an agreement with Russell Stover to market and produce the product.  The handwritten agreement is part of a display at the Monona County Historical Museum in Onawa.

Onawa was the site of a POW camp for captured German soldiers, sometime between 1944 and 1946. Historical documents indicate there were never more than 50 POWs in camp. A larger camp existed near the central Iowa town of [[Algona, Iowa|Algona]], and housed as many as 5,400 German POWs.

[[Image:AlbiaMines.png|thumb|left|480px|Map of the Albia area from 1908, showing the railroads, mining camps and coal mines (in red) of the region.]]

On Feb. 14, 1893, there was a [[coal mine]] explosion in Chicago and Iowa mine, about 2.5 miles west of Albia.  This [[room and pillar]] mine opened around 1877, and by the time of the explosion, mining extended more than 1000 yards from the [[mine shaft|hoisting shaft]] and the mine employed 60 miners and 20 other men. One miner was killed outright and seven died later of their injuries, after a &quot;shot&quot; (gunpower charge used to bring down the coal) ignited a [[dust explosion]] in the mine. This was one of only two major mine disasters in Iowa between 1888 and 1913.&lt;ref&gt;Albert H. Fay, [http://books.google.com/books?id=R38fAAAAYAAJ&amp;lpg=PA20&amp;pg=RA1-PA190 Coal-Mine Fatalities in the United States 1870-1914], Department of the Interior, Bureau of Mines, Washington DC, 1916, page 190.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=PRAAAAAAMAAJ&amp;lpg=RA4-PA29&amp;pg=RA4-PA29 Sixth Biennial Report of the State Mine Inspectors to the Governor of the State of Iowa for the Two Yers Ending June 30, 1893], Ragsdale, Des Moines, 1893, pages 29-35.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Villisca murders==
{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2007}}
On June 10, 1912, six members of the Moore family and two young houseguests were killed with an axe by an unknown assailant. The case has inspired two published books: Roy Marshall's ''Villisca'' and Stephen Bowman's fictionalized ''Morning Ran Red''. Kelly and Tammy Rundle's documentary ''Villisca: Living with a Mystery'' also dealt with the incident.

The case has also inspired a feature narrative project entitled ''Haunting Villisca'', co-authored by James Serpento and Kimberly Busbee, directed by Serpento and produced by Busbee for AriesWorks Entertainment. ''Haunting Villisca'' combines a fictionalized present-day scenario with scenes suggested by courtroom transcripts, folklore and current paranormal investigations of the house where the murders occurred. The picture premiered in Villisca in the spring of 2008.

'''Muscatine''' is a city in [[Muscatine County, Iowa|Muscatine County]], [[Iowa]], [[United States]]. The population was 22,697 at the 2000 census. It is the [[county seat]] of [[Muscatine County, Iowa|Muscatine County]]{{GR|6}}. The name Muscatine is unusual in that it is not used by any other city in the [[United States]].&lt;ref name=&quot;History&quot;&gt;[http://www.muscatine.com/gmcci/?page=30 &quot;The Prosperous Industrial History of Muscatine&quot;] Greater Muscatine Chamber of Commerce &amp; Industry, 2004. Retrieved 2008-05-09.&lt;/ref&gt;

Muscatine is the principal city of the Muscatine [[Muscatine micropolitan area|Micropolitan Statistical Area]] (2000 census population 53,905), which includes all of Muscatine and [[Louisa County, Iowa|Louisa]] counties.

== History ==
[[File:Muscatine IA Barber 1865p533cropped.jpg|thumb|left|Muscatine in 1865.]]
Muscatine began as a trading post founded by representatives of Colonel [[George Davenport]] in 1833. Muscatine was incorporated as Bloomington in 1839, but the name was changed to reduce mail delivery confusion as there were several Bloomingtons in the Midwest. Before that, Muscatine had also been known as &quot;Casey's Woodpile&quot;. The name ''Muscatine'' is believed by some to be named after the [[Mascouten]] native American tribe.&lt;ref name=&quot;History&quot;/&gt; The Mascoutins were driven out of Michigan in approx 1642 and assumedly absorbed into the Foxes and Sac tribes by the early 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=QBIuaF3ZGVwC&amp;pg=PA65&amp;lpg=PA65&amp;dq=Musquotamenis%E2%80%8F&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=iSyctUqHTI&amp;sig=ni8uZAtF9OwOAyxlpOS-B02P0gM&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=mxXySt6GO860tgfQuN26Cw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CAkQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Musquotamenis%E2%80%8F&amp;f=false John Brown among the Quakers: and other sketches By Irving Berdine Richman]&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|66}} In 1819 Muscatine Island was known as Mascoutin Island. An alternative theory is that it is derived from a Siouan term meaning &quot;Fire Island&quot;. William Williams, who was present when the town changed its name in 1849, reported in his journal that &quot;Muscatine in English is Fire Island&quot; in his list of Sioux Indian names.&lt;ref name=&quot;williams1&quot; /&gt;

On May 25, 1849, Maj. William Williams visited Muscatine and provided a brief description in his journal:&lt;ref name=&quot;williams1&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Williams|first=William|year=1920|title=Major William Williams' Journal of a trip to Iowa in 1849|journal=Annals of Iowa|volume=12|issue=4|pages=249–250, with minor spelling and punctuation changes}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Bloomington is a fine town, one of the most important points in the state. Its situation on one of the great bends of the Mississippi has great commercial advantages; [it] is the seat of justice of Muscatine County. Contains about 2000 inhabitants, is the natural depository for a vast amount of trade from the surrounding country, has many neat residences and several spacious brick mercantile establishments- a large steam mill, one smaller one, two printing establishments, 6 churches, 4 physicians, 8 lawyers, an neat court house and jail, Masonic lodge, etc.... This town is very prettily situated, in part on a level on the river for two streets back, when the ground rises and the remaining street is elevated in benches, the whole standing in a rise enclosed by a range of high bluffs which runs around it in a semicircular form, forming beautiful sites for residences. From the bluff there is a beautiful view of the town below and of the Mississippi for miles up and down. All steam boats land here, passing up and down. 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A [[button]] company was founded in 1884 by a German immigrant named J.F. Boepple, producing buttons by punching them out of [[clam]] shells harvested from the [[Mississippi River]]. Muscatine was known as the &quot;Pearl Button Capital of the World.&quot; Hole-punched clam shells can still be found along the riverfront.

From the 1840s to the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], Muscatine had Iowa's largest black community, consisting of fugitive [[History of slavery in the United States|slave]]s from the South and free blacks who had migrated from the eastern states. One of the most prominent community leaders was Alexander Clark Sr., a [[Pennsylvania]] native, [[barber]] and eventually a wealthy timber salesman and real estate speculator who helped found the local [[AME Church]], assisted fugitive slaves, and petitioned the state government to overturn racist laws before the war. In 1863, Clark helped organize Iowa's black regiment, the 60th United States Colored Infantry (originally known as the 1st Iowa Infantry, African Descent), though an injury prevented him from serving. In 1868, he successfully desegregated Iowa's public schools by suing the Muscatine school board after his daughter Susan was turned away from her neighborhood learning center. Eleven years later his son Alexander Jr. became the first black graduate of the [[University of Iowa]] College of Law, and in fact its first black graduate from any department. Clark Sr. became the second black graduate five years later despite being fifty-eight years old, saying that he wanted to serve “as an example to young men of his own race.” Clark also rose to prominence in the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]], serving as a delegate to various state and national conventions. In 1890, he was appointed ambassador to [[Liberia]] by President [[Benjamin Harrison]]. In fact he was one of four Muscatine residents to serve as a diplomatic envoy between 1855 and 1900, a remarkable feat for a town of such small size: George Van Horne was consul at [[Marseilles]], [[France]] during the 1860s; Samuel McNutt served at [[Maracaibo]], [[Venezuela]] in 1890; and [[Frank W. Mahin]] represented his country in [[Reichenberg]], [[Austria]] in 1900. Less than a year after arriving in [[West Africa]], however, Clark died of fever. He was laid to rest in Muscatine's Greenwood Cemetery. In 1975 a low-income apartment complex for senior citizens was built on the site of his long-time home and named the Alexander Clark House. The actual home in which he lived towards the end of his life was lifted from its foundation and moved to a new site about two hundred feet away. The [[University of Iowa]]'s chapter of the Black Law Students Association (BLSA) is named for the Clarks as a testament to their accomplishments and their place in the history of civil rights in Iowa.

Sam Clemens (better known by his pen-name [[Mark Twain]]) worked for a while at the local newspaper, the Muscatine Journal, which was partly owned by his brother, Orion Clemens. He lived in Muscatine in the summer of 1855.  He made a few recollections of Muscatine in his book ''[[Life on the Mississippi]]''.

[[Image:Former Hotel Muscatine.JPG|right|thumb|200px||Former Hotel Muscatine had recently been remodeled. However, the remodeling had been controversial; opponents stated that the changes would ruin the history of the building.]]

{{cquote|And I remember Muscatine—still more pleasantly—for its summer sunsets. I have never seen any, on either side of the ocean, that equaled them. They used the broad smooth river as a canvas, and painted on it every imaginable dream of color, from the mottled daintinesses and delicacies of the opal, all the way up, through cumulative intensities, to blinding purple and crimson conflagrations which were enchanting to the eye, but sharply tried it at the same time. All the Upper Mississippi region has these extraordinary sunsets as a familiar spectacle. It is the true Sunset Land: I am sure no other country can show so good a right to the name. The sunrises are also said to be exceedingly fine. I do not know.|4=Mark Twain}}

His other, less flattering recollection of Muscatine is of being accosted by a lunatic who threatened to kill him if he did not proclaim the man the one and only son of the Devil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Life on the Mississippi|author=Twain, Mark|year=1901 |publisher=Harper|page=408|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=5IRaAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA408|quote=But I remember it best for a lunatic who caught me out in the fields, one Sunday, and extracted a butcher-knife from his boot and proposed to carve me up with it, unless I acknowledged him to be the only son of the Devil.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Muscatine's slogan, &quot;Pearl of the Mississippi,&quot; refers to the days when pearl button manufacturing by the McKee Button Company was a significant economic contributor. In 1915, Weber &amp; Sons Button Co., Inc. was the world's largest producer of fancy freshwater pearl buttons. From that time forward, Muscatine was known as &quot;The Pearl Button Capital of the World&quot;. Weber is still manufacturing today, and celebrated its 100-year anniversary in 2004. Next to the mother of pearl button history, Muscatine is nearly as well known as the &quot;Watermelon Capital of the World&quot;.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}

Accessed 2007-06-01.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Industry ==

Companies in Muscatine include [[HNI Corporation]], Bridgestone Bandag, Heinz, Carver Pump, Monsanto, Muscatine Foods Corporation, Musco and The Stanley Group.

Headquartered in Muscatine, [[The HON Company]] designs and manufactures [[office furniture]] including [[chairs]], [[filing cabinet]]s, workstations, [[Table (furniture)|tables]], [[desks]] and education furniture.

==Media==
===Print===
The [[Muscatine Journal]] newspaper circulates daily throughout the Muscatine area except on Sundays.  It is commonly believed to have existed since 1840.

===Radio===
Prairie Radio Communications, a midwestern broadcasting company, has two radio stations in Muscatine. KWPC-AM, which has been a long part of the city's history, and KMCS-FM, which has only been in the community since 1995. Cumulus Broadcasting's KBEA-FM broadcasts from a tower near [[Wilton, Iowa|Wilton]], 10 Miles north of Muscatine.

==Geography==
According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of 17.9&amp;nbsp;square miles (46.3&amp;nbsp;km²), of which, 16.8&amp;nbsp;square miles (43.6&amp;nbsp;km²) of it is land and 1.0&amp;nbsp;square miles (2.7&amp;nbsp;km²) of it (5.87%) is water.

Muscatine is primarily located on a series of bluffs and hills at a major west-south bend in the [[Mississippi River]].  The river-bend gives the city roughly 260 degrees of riverfront.  The &quot;highland&quot; area of the town is divided into three ridge-like hills by Papoose Creek and Madd Creek, each of which flow individually into the Mississippi in downtown Muscatine.  The city's main roads follow these ridges and valleys in a spider-web-like fashion.  Several large working-class neighborhoods and industrial sectors have been built on what is called &quot;[[Muscatine Island]]&quot;.  This flat, sandy expanse was largely underwater when a portion of the Mississippi River followed the course of the present-day [[Muscatine Slough]].  It is unclear when the river changed course.  The hills, river, and island are all integral to the diversity of Muscatine's economy and housing sector.  As the city's urbanized area develops, the areas of highest elevation in the &quot;High Prairie&quot; crescent (between the Cedar and Mississippi Rivers) are increasingly re-appropriated from agricultural land to suburban housing.

Muscatine is located along two designated routes of Iowa's &quot;[[Commercial-Industrial Network]]&quot;, [[U.S. Highway 61]] and [[Iowa Highway 92]].  Highway 61 serves as a major agricultural-industry route to the south from [[Burlington, IA]] to Muscatine, where it becomes a heavy-industrial and major commuter route to the northeast between Muscatine and [[Davenport, IA]].  In conjunction with Iowa 92, which provides access to the [[Avenue of the Saints]] ([[U.S. 218]]/[[IA 27]]) to the west and the lightly-populated western Illinois via the [[Norbert Beckey Bridge]] to the east, Highway 61 serves as a shortcut for traffic from northeastern Missouri and southeastern Iowa en route to the [[Quad Cities]], Chicago, and points beyond.  Several regional highway improvement projects are in the works to further establish and capitalize on this trade-route.  Additionally, Muscatine is connected to [[Interstate 80]] to the north by fifteen miles of [[Iowa Highway 38]].

Positioned some 25 miles (30 minutes) from the Quad Cities, 38 miles (52 minutes) from [[Iowa City, IA]] and some 68 miles (75 minutes) from [[Cedar Rapids, IA]], Muscatine is the smallest link in a non-contiguous populated area which surpassed 800,000 residents in the decade following the 2000 Census.  The key feature of this region is that although the populated areas are non-contiguous, a high percentage of residents commute between the cities for work, particularly those in professional fields.  Despite this relatively high regional density, Muscatine has struggled to become the modern city that its size and resources would suggest, instead deferring to the larger cities around it for many commercial services and educational, medical and cultural advancements.

'''Primghar''' is a city in and the [[county seat]] of [[O'Brien County, Iowa|O'Brien County]], [[Iowa]], [[United States]], [[United States]].{{GR|6}} The population was 891 at the [[2000 United States Census|2000 census]].

==History==
In a brief history of O'Brien County, Arthur M. Schierholz states: &quot;the courthouse location in (the village of) O'Brien in the extreme southeast corner of the county became a growing issue. To resolve the matter, an election was held on November 11, 1872, to determine the location of the courthouse.&quot; A total of 360 votes were cast, with 307 voting to move the courthouse to the exact geographical center of the county. Another historian wrote, &quot;Probably the only case in Iowa, perhaps anywhere, where a bare spot of raw prairie was actually voted to be the county seat.&quot; This eventually became the town of Primghar.  The name Primghar was received from the first letter of eight people who had a major part in platting the town.&lt;ref&gt;[http://obriencounty.com/history.htm History of O'Brien County]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==
Primghar is located at {{coord|43|5|16|N|95|37|40|W|city}} (43.087722, -95.627892){{GR|1}}.

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of 1.4&amp;nbsp;square miles (3.6&amp;nbsp;km²), all f it land.

===Topography===
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2009}}

Elevation is 1520 feet. This area of northwest Iowa is gently rolling. Today fields are marred by few boggy areas and much of the land is terraced to reduce erosion. Until fill was hauled in, the south side of the courthouse square was a &quot;boggy, muddy slough.&quot; When the first settlers arrived there were few trees and almost without exception prairie grass grew to six foot. 

In the immediate vicinity of Primghar the topsoils and subsoils are silty clay loam. (Galva, Marcus, Primghar, and Sac soils by name.) Clay loam glacial till is at a depth of 30 to 60&amp;nbsp;inches in most places. There are no mineral assets of commercial value save rock and gravel. Back in 1873 this dearth of underground wealth was yet to be decided. There was a $1000 reward posted for anyone finding mineable coal reserves. No one claimed the prize. 

There is an abandoned rock quarry a mile SSE of Primghar which was donated by the Tjossem family to Primghar in 1989 and is now known as Tjossem Park, a fishing area and public picnic/camp ground.

'''Clarinda''' is a city in and the [[county seat]] of [[Page County, Iowa|Page County]], [[Iowa]], [[United States]].{{GR|6}} The population was 5,690 at the [[2000 United States Census|2000 census]].

==History==
Clarinda was founded in 1851.  Many stories are told of such notables as [[Jesse James]] frequently passing through. In 1884, the citizens rallied to build the third [[mental hospital]] in the state of Iowa. Today, the Clarinda State Hospital is known as the [[Clarinda Treatment Complex]] and the hospital is located on the north end of the city. Clarinda also holds a state [[prison]] called the [[Clarinda Correctional Facility]].

It is named for Clarinda Buck who according to legend had carried water to the surveyors when Page County was first being surveyed.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iowacounties.org/Corporate%20Opportunities/About%20Us/AboutCoGov/County%20Pages/Page.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1943 during World War II, an [[internment camp]] designed for 3,000 [[prisoners of war]] with 60 barracks and a 150 bed hospital was built in Clarinda.  German prisoners were the first to arrive in Camp Clarinda followed by Italian and Japanese POWs in 1945.&lt;ref&gt;Sullivan, Ken. - &quot;POW camps - Thousands of German prisoners held during war in Iowa, Midwest&quot;. - ''[[The Gazette]]''. - December 16, 2001. | - Kilen, Mike. - &quot;When War Marched Into Iowa&quot;. - ''[[Des Moines Register]]''. - September 23, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Camp Clarinda was located by what today is the town's municipal airport Schenck Field (named for aviator/farmer Ray Schenck who built the original Clarinda airport on the location).

Clarinda's southeast area of town was named Gun Town and is still known today by that name. A noted author wrote &quot;In the twenties and thirties Clarinda seemed to be two separate towns; Guntown and Uptown. In the middle of the square, was and still is, the Courthouse. The four blocks surrounding it are filled with businesses. Guntown was a town all its own. The 700 block of East Garfield was a solid block of businesses. Grocery stores, barber, a Guntown Chinaman had a restaurant, another corner restaurant, rug factory, large grocery, Swifts packing plant, railroad tracks with freight depot and roundhouse to turn trains around.&quot; (&quot;Gun Town My Hometown&quot; by Juanita Seeley)

==Geography==
Clarinda is located at {{coord|40|44|15|N|95|2|9|W|type:city}} (40.737599, -95.035928){{GR|1}} along the [[Nodaway River|West Nodaway River]] just north of the confluence of the East Nodaway River.

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of 5.2&amp;nbsp;square miles (13.5&amp;nbsp;km²), of which, 5.2&amp;nbsp;square miles (13.4&amp;nbsp;km²) of it is land and 0.04&amp;nbsp;square miles (0.1&amp;nbsp;km²) of it (0.57%) is water.
