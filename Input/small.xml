'''Pine Village''' is a town in [[Adams Township, Warren County, Indiana|Adams Township]], [[Warren County, Indiana|Warren County]], [[Indiana]], [[United States]]. The population was 255 at the 2000 census.

==Geography==
Pine Village is located at the intersection of [[Indiana State Road 55|State Road 55]] and [[Indiana State Road 26|State Road 26]], near [[Big Pine Creek (Indiana)|Big Pine Creek]].{{GR|1}}  It is about {{convert|20|mi}} west of [[Lafayette, Indiana|Lafayette]] and about {{convert|14|mi}} east of the [[Illinois]] border.

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the town has a total area of {{convert|0.126|sqmi}}, all of it land.

==History==
The town was founded at the location of a trading post called Pine Village, which may have been named for a lone pine tree that stood on the bluff of Pine Creek, or it may have been named for the creek itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Baker|first1=Ronald L.|last2=Carmony|first2=Marvin|publisher=Indiana University Press|year=1975|location=Bloomington, Indiana|title=Indiana Place Names|page=130}}&lt;/ref&gt; The town was laid out in 1851 by Isaac and John R. Metsker, and the plat map was made by county surveyor Perrin Kent.  The Methodist Church was already there; it was built several years earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

===Rail service===
Rail service reached the town in the 1870s.  The year 1883 witnessed the completion of a north/south [[Chicago and Great Southern Railway]] (later the [[Chicago and Indiana Coal Railway]]) line between [[Attica, Indiana|Attica]] and [[Fair Oaks, Indiana|Fair Oaks]], which subsequently came under the ownership of the [[Chicago and Eastern Illinois Railroad]].  The line came to be known as the &quot;Coal Road&quot; for the large quantities of [[coal]] transported along it.  When the C&amp;EI floundered in the early 1920s, Charles F. Propst purchased the Coal Road and in October 1922 incorporated it as the [[Chicago, Attica and Southern Railroad]].  The CA&amp;S was placed in [[receivership]] on August 5, 1931, and incremental abandonment occurred over subsequent years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The area on the east side of Pine Village near the railroad, consisting of a grain elevator and some homes, was known as Oklahoma&lt;ref name=&quot;awapv&quot; /&gt; and is located at {{coord|40|26|59|N|87|14|42|W|type:landmark_region:US-IN|name=Oklahoma}}.

===Football===
From a historical marker entitled &quot;Pine Village Football&quot;, located near the town fire station: &lt;blockquote&gt;Local team was important Indiana precursor to modern professional [[American football|football]] organizations.  Clinton Beckett introduced football to Pine Village High School 1898. Town and high school teams played on bottomland, northwest of here, starting local football tradition. Town team, the Villagers, managed by C.J. Shackleton and later by Claire Rhode. Team became &quot;professional&quot; 1915, claiming state and regional championships. Jim Thorpe, All-American, played for Villagers in 1915 Thanksgiving Day game against [[Purdue University|Purdue]] All-Stars: Villagers won 29 to 0. Team was a founder of Indiana Football League 1917. Following World War I, the Villagers played intermittently until 1927.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''State Line City''' is a town in [[Kent Township, Warren County, Indiana|Kent Township]], [[Warren County, Indiana|Warren County]], [[Indiana]], [[United States]], located along the state's border with [[Illinois]].  As of the [[United States Census Bureau|2000 census]], the town population was 141.  The small section of town that protrudes west across the border is formally known as [[Illiana, Illinois]].

==History==
[[Image:State Line Lincoln marker.png|thumb|left|150px|A marker commemorates [[Abraham Lincoln|Lincoln]]'s speech.]]
In the mid-1850s, two large railway lines converged on the Indiana-Illinois state line – the narrow-gauge [[Wabash Valley Railroad]], whose route from the east crossed Warren County and reached the border in October 1856, and the standard-gauge [[Great Western Railroad (Illinois)|Great Western Railroad]], which shortly thereafter reached the state line from the west.  State Line City was platted on June 29, 1857 by Robert Casement at the convergence of these two railroads.  The city flourished, and within 10 years had reached a population of approximately 550, but because of the drinking and carousing of the numerous railroaders it gained an unsavory reputation.&lt;ref name=&quot;hwc&quot;&gt;{{cite book

On February 11, 1861, [[Abraham Lincoln]] stopped in State Line on his way from [[Springfield, Illinois]] to [[Washington, D.C.]] for his inauguration.  He dined at the Frazier Eating House, then gave a short speech to a crowd in the public square before resuming his journey.  A historical marker on the site commemorates the event.

[[Image:State Line City Indiana map from 1877 atlas.png|thumb|right|150px|Map from 1877 atlas]]
The town's post office was established in July 1857, with Robert Casement as the first postmaster, and continues to operate today from a newer building on Woodard Street.  Grain elevators were erected in the fall of 1857, but fires in September 1900, December 1932 and June 1984 each completely destroyed the structures, which were subsequently rebuilt.  State Line's grain elevators are currently operated by [[Archer Daniels Midland]] of [[Decatur, Illinois]], and see considerable activity during harvest time.  The town's other large business is a fertilizer and agricultural sales facility northeast of town, built in 1975 and currently operated by Westland Co-Op. 

[[Image:State Line Palmer House.png|thumb|left|150px|The Palmer House, originally an [[Independent Order of Odd Fellows|Odd Fellows]] hall.]]
Other establishments in State Line include the Kent Township Fire Department, formed in 1978, which took over local fire protection responsibilities from the West Lebanon Fire Department; in 2000, however, the department merged back with West Lebanon, which now maintains the State Line fire station.  The KTFD sponsored for a number of years an annual town festival called the State Line Fun Days, but this is no longer held.  

As of 2007, State Line houses one active church: the State Line Christian Church, built in 1868.  Rev. Gerald Burt has been the pastor there since 1972.  The Church of the Nazarene (built around 1860 as a Presbyterian church and purchased for use as a Nazarene church in 1929) and the Methodist Church (built in 1863-4) were both disbanded due to low attendance in the 1990s and have since been turned into homes.  Rev. Jim Kessler was the last pastor at the Nazarene church.

==Geography==
State Line City is located in the southwestern part of the county in open farm land along the border with Illinois, five miles northeast of the city of [[Danville, Illinois|Danville]].  According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the town has a total area of {{convert|0.135|sqmi}}, all of it land.

The [[Norfolk Southern Railway]] runs southwest through town.  For many years the famous [[Wabash Cannonball]] ran on the line (then owned by the Wabash Railway), passing through town twice a day on its route from [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]] to [[Detroit, Michigan|Detroit]] and back.  The Wabash Railway merged in the mid 1960s with the Norfolk and Western Railway, which in turn merged with Southern Railway in the 1980s to become Norfolk Southern, officially bringing an end to the Wabash name.

==Demographics==
As of the [[census]]{{GR|2}} of 2000, there were 141 people, 54 households, and 36 families residing in the town. The [[population density]] was 1,046.9 people per square mile (418.8/km²). There were 56 housing units at an average density of 415.8/sq&amp;nbsp;mi (166.3/km²). The racial makeup of the town was 98.58% [[White (U.S. Census)|White]], 0.71% [[African American (U.S. Census)|African American]], 0.71% from [[Race (United States Census)|other races]]. [[Hispanic (U.S. Census)|Hispanic]] or [[Latino (U.S. Census)|Latino]] of any race were 1.42% of the population.

There were 54 households out of which 33.3% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 64.8% were [[Marriage|married couples]] living together, 1.9% had a female householder with no husband present, and 31.5% were non-families. 27.8% of all households were made up of individuals and 9.3% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.61 and the average family size was 3.27.

In the town the population was spread out with 28.4% under the age of 18, 5.7% from 18 to 24, 32.6% from 25 to 44, 24.1% from 45 to 64, and 9.2% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 36 years. For every 100 females there were 120.3 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 110.4 males.

The median income for a household in the town was $34,250, and the median income for a family was $41,607. Males had a median income of $30,625 versus $14,000 for females. The [[per capita income]] for the town was $15,685. There were none of the families and 3.7% of the population living below the [[poverty line]], including no under eighteens and none of those over 64.

'''West Lebanon''' is a town in [[Pike Township, Warren County, Indiana|Pike Township]], [[Warren County, Indiana|Warren County]], [[Indiana]], [[United States]]. The population was 793 at the 2000 census.

==History==
[[Image:West Lebanon, Indiana map from 1877 atlas.png|thumb|right|155px|Map from 1877 atlas]]
West Lebanon was laid out and [[plat]]ted in the fall of 1830 by Ebenezer Purviance, John G. Jemison and Andrew Fleming, and consisted of 64 lots.  Originally named Lebanon, the name was changed to West Lebanon in 1869 when the town was incorporated, possibly in deference to [[Lebanon, Indiana|the Boone County community of the same name]] which established its post office on December 15, 1832, just eleven days before their own.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Baker|first1=Ronald L.|last2=Carmony|first2=Marvin|publisher=Indiana University Press|year=1975|location=Bloomington, Indiana|title=Indiana Place Names|page=176}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not being close to any waterways, West Lebanon's early growth was relatively slow and for many years had no more than 20 families.  However, with the completion of the [[Wabash Railroad]] line one mile north of town in 1856, the community's fortunes improved and led to most of the town relocating closer to the station.  The original settlement area became known as Old Town.

'''Williamsport''' is a town in [[Washington Township, Warren County, Indiana|Washington Township]], [[Warren County, Indiana|Warren County]], [[Indiana]], [[United States]].  The population was 1,935 at the 2000 census.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/SAFFFacts?_event=Search&amp;geo_id=&amp;_geoContext=&amp;_street=&amp;_county=williamsport&amp;_cityTown=williamsport&amp;_state=04000US18&amp;_zip=&amp;_lang=en&amp;_sse=on&amp;pctxt=fph&amp;pgsl=010&amp;show_2003_tab=&amp;redirect=Y|title=Census 2000 data for Williamsport|accessdate=2010-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The city is the [[county seat]] of [[Warren County, Indiana|Warren County]].{{GR|6}}  It is home to [[Williamsport Falls]], the highest waterfall in the state.

==History==
Williamsport was [[plat]]ted by (and named for) William Harrison on December 11, 1828,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Baker|first1=Ronald L.|last2=Carmony|first2=Marvin|publisher=Indiana University Press|year=1975|location=Bloomington, Indiana|title=Indiana Place Names|page=181}}&lt;/ref&gt; on the south end of the eastern fractional part of the northeast quarter of section 11, township 21, range 8.  Harrison was the first to occupy the town in the fall of 1828, building a log house at the east end of Main Street near the river, and operated a ferry crossing there for several years.  Though located on the opposite side of the river from the [[Wabash and Erie Canal]], Williamsport sought to draw shipping traffic by constructing a short cut-off canal.  Finished around 1852, the project led to the nickname &quot;Side-Cut City&quot;.

Williamsport became the county seat in June 1829, taking the title away from short-lived [[Warrenton, Indiana|Warrenton]].  Its post office was the first in the county and has operated since September 28, 1829.  The town was incorporated in March 1854, at which time its population was 552.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

[[James Frank Hanly]], who was the Governor of Indiana from 1905 to 1909, lived and practiced law here from 1879 to 1896; he is buried at [[List of cemeteries in Warren County, Indiana#Hillside|Hillside Cemetery]], on the northeast side of town.

The [[Williamsport-Washington Township Public Library]] opened in 1917 as a [[Carnegie library]], and moved to a new facility in 2002.

===Historic Places===
The Williamsport [[Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.)|Presbyterian Church]] at 15 Fall Street, built in 1889, appears on the [[Indiana Register of Historic Sites and Structures]].  It was closed in 1964 and stood vacant until 1991, when a non-profit corporation was set up to support the restoration effort.  It was listed in 1998 after having received a new slate roof and other repairs.  The building contains the original stained glass windows, bell, pulpit, and pews.

The &quot;Tower House&quot; can be found at 303 Lincoln Street and was constructed in 1845.  The house was nicknamed due to its 3 story tower on the northeast corner of the building.  The house was originally constructed as a mirrored twin; the twin house was destroyed by a fire in the 1990s.  The house has changed from its original construction.  An enclosed front porch and side porch has been retooled to serve as the current family's kitchen area.  The house originally contained two large rooms upstairs, and three rooms downstairs.  What appears to be the summer kitchen and original carriage house still stand.  The house now has five bedrooms, one bath upstairs and seven rooms, an enclosed porch, and a bath downstairs.

The [[Warren County Courthouse (Indiana)|Warren County Courthouse]] at 125 North Monroe Street was built in 1907-1908 and is on the United States [[National Register of Historic Places]].  It is the fourth purpose-built court house in the county's history.

==Geography==
Williamsport is located along [[Indiana State Road 28|State Road 28]] near the shores of the [[Wabash River]] which forms the eastern border of the county.  Its most striking natural feature is [[Williamsport Falls]], a 90-foot [[waterfall]] near the center of town and Indiana's tallest.  Williamsport's original section (&quot;Old Town&quot;) is in bottom land next to the river; &quot;New Town&quot; was built on the hill above it to be closer to the railroad.  The rail line through town is currently operated by [[Norfolk Southern Railway]].

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the town has a total area of {{convert|1.05|sqmi}}, all of it land.

==History==
From 1100 to 1450 AD, a community of several thousand mound-building [[Angel Mounds|Mississippian culture people]] lived in the Newburgh area. No one knows why they left. John Sprinkle, a businessman of German descent, landed here in the spring of 1803, thirteen years before [[Indiana]] entered the Union as the 19th state. The community he founded became known as Sprinklesburg, and it was the first town in Warrick County. In 1837, the name of the town was changed to Newburgh. By 1850, Newburgh had grown to be one of the largest riverports on the Ohio-Mississippi River between [[Cincinnati]] and [[New Orleans]].

{{main article|Newburgh Raid}}
On July 18, 1862, Newburgh was the first town north of the [[Mason-Dixon line]] to be captured by the [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] forces during the [[American Civil War]]. Colonel [[Adam Johnson (colonel)|Adam R. Johnson]], with a [[Partisan (military)|partisan]] band, crossed the Ohio River and confiscated supplies and ammunition without a shot being fired. The Confederates would have been unable to shell the city (as promised) had Newburgh put up a fight. The Confederates' &quot;cannons&quot; were an assemblage of stove pipe, a charred log, and wagon wheels.

Newburgh grew steadily during the second half of the 20th Century with the increase of industry in the Evansville Metropolitan Area. Major area employers include Alcoa, Toyota Motors, Mead Johnson Pharmaceuticals, Atlas Van Lines, the University of Evansville, and the University of Southern Indiana. Today, Newburgh boasts a lively historic district along with [[Castle High School (Indiana)|Castle High School]] that competes in statewide competitions in both athletics and academics.

On November 6, 2005, the [[Evansville Tornado of November 2005]] caused 25 deaths in nearby Evansville. Newburgh suffered extensive property damage and some injuries, but fortunately suffered no fatalities during the 2:06 AM tornado strike.

Each summer, Newburgh also hosts a number of festivals including the Fiddler Fest and the Strawberry Festival. Most are held on the shore of the river near to the town's lock and dam in the &quot;antique&quot; section of Newburgh.

In 2006, the [[United States Senior Men's Amateur Golf Championship]] was hosted in Newburgh at the [[Victoria National Golf Course]].
